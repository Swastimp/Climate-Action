--Problem Statement : 
Creating a web platform to mobilize action on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience-building efforts at local, national, and global levels.

--Objectives : 
The objective is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by
mobilizing resources and implementing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and build resilience in vulnerable communities

--Describing the technology Stack : 
We are using HTML – for structure ,
Cascading Style Sheet- to style and
JavaScript – for creating interactive interface

We first create a basic web structure using HTML.

And then using CSS we style different options as required for example: search box ,
input , weather, temperature, humidity and many other sections as per the requirement
to make it more accurate.

Now using javascript we write the code for the actual problem statement.

Firstly we take the input from the user that is the specific location name, and then the output
is displayed based on the weather at that particular location.

--Expected Result:
To show different conditions like wind , humidity , temperature etc of a particular location
to analyze the weather condition.

--Conclusion : 
A simple interactive web page inorder to understand and analyze the
weather condition of a particular city or a location taking it as a
input from the user to make predictions or calculations as required.
